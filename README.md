These are my lectures of Artificial Intelligence traiunig that I deleivered in a 2 momths program at Arfa Karim Technology Incubator. In this course, we trained the
students from scratch teachin them the basics of pythn programming. Moving forwards, we gained expertise in pandas and numpy in python and by the time students were able to
derive useful insights from data. Stepping into Machine learning, we studies various machine learning models and gained hands-on experience bby training ML models on different
real life datasets. Throughout the course, students were able to understand NLP concepts in detail, ML models and also trained images data by applying deep learning. Till the end, 
students made their own robust projects like Deep-fake audio detection, Text-to-image convertor, Jarivs project, movie trend analyzer etc. If you want to learn Artifical Intelligence,m
